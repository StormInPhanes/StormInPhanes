Arasay stands as an ancient lineage of monarchs that predates the emergence of demonic sects and customs within the wider realm of [[Zykh]]. The Arasay doctrine centers on combating chaos and upholding law and order within their dominion. The enduring commitment and determination of Arasay can be traced back to the fundamental philosophy deeply rooted in their culture, which rejects the veneration of deities and presents gods as mere entities embroiled in petty disputes for dominion over mortals. Instead, Arasay advocates channeling one's inner strength. Notably, Arasay has gained renown for its warrior monks, who engage in lengthy meditations and safeguard their borders against aggressive intruders such as [[Molekith]].
