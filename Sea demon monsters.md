LPH, thanks to [[Jasper Seraph]], discovered that the attack on [[Gray Port]] is the consequence of an opening in the abyss (probably involving the use of runes) that lets demons project themselves into our demiplane. That's why the demons don't leave behind an actual carcass but only a pile of black goo. 
The black biomass is the only leftover of the planar projection. When demons "die" in our demiplane they don't die in the abyss.
There are places where the curtain between the planes in thinner, called wounds. These wounds are normally located in the site of a cataclysm.

[[Jasper Seraph]] also informs LPH that these are an unusual type of demons. There could be a force/mastermind behind the attacks and/or behind these "mutated" demons.

Type of sea monster LPH encountered:
- Invisible imp/gremlin looking creatures
- Tentacled creatures
- Giant demon crabs
- Shadow demons that possess humanoids
- Medusa-like creatures that can animate dead bodies

Some of the monsters can throw acid, some are resistant to fire, acid and poison damage.
