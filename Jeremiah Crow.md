AKA the Vagrant, is the leader of [[Vagrant's Retreat]].

A tall man (2 M), around 30/40 years old, brandishes a great axe, long hay colored hair, wears an old-school jacket and is missing an eye. His face looks noble but there is cruelty in his eye.
He is a legendary pirate from [[Umun]] but disappeared 10 years ago, he apparently established a new pirate cove in [[Vagrant's Retreat]].
Nobody knows where he is really from. Some says he's from the north because of his white skin and his height. He likes riches but he's a man of his word.

[[Oliden The Terrible]] is one of the captains of the Council of Captains, the assembly that elected Crow as their leader.

He lives in a magically beached ship called the [[Cleaver]]. 

Crow has multiple maps of [[Phanes]]. The map of [[Orthrus]] in particular is very detailed and includes a subterranean tunnel layer. There is also maps of the [[Crown of madness]], but less detailed.

[[Maurice Dellunay]] and LPH delivered the [[Lion's Eyes]] to him and received a payment in platinum.

[[Jonah Blackthorn]] told LPH that Jeremiah Crow has a secret dealing with [[Damian Moreau]].
On one hand [[Damian Moreau]] buys treasures and the chemicals to produce [[Rage]] from the buccaneers and leaves [[Vagrant's Retreat]] alone, and on the other hand Jeremiah Crow agrees not to attack [[Caducea]]n ships and not to get involved in any weapon dealings with [[Molekith]].
Ties between the two can also be deduced from the fact that both the box of muskets that [[Damian Moreau]] told LPH to look for at the [[Gray Port Warehouse]] and a crate spotted on the [[Cleaver]] boast the same insignia of a crow perched on a battleaxe.

After discovering that [[Jonah Blackthorn]] has snitched on him, Crow asks for [[Jonah Blackthorn]] to be brought to him.
