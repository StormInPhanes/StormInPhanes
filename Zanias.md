Zanias presents himself to [[Kork Vingård]] as a fellow student and member of the [[Hermetic Order]]. He tells [[Kork Vingård]] that he has been sent by the council of students to explore the [[Antediluvians]] in [[Phanes]].

He asks LPH to join him in the exploration of an [[Antediluvians]] underground archeological site that sits right under [[Vagrant's Retreat]]. By talking to the barkeeper, LPH discovers that entrance to the underground site has been prohibited by [[Jeremiah Crow]], since multiple people have disappeared after entering it.

Zanias's story doesn't convince LPH. LPH reads his thoughts and discover that there is nothing but a blank void filled only by static sounds in his mind. After Zanias retreats to his room LPH follows him and discovers that Zanias is in reality a 5M tall demon.
After a very hard fight (for LPH unfortunately), Zanias runs away.
