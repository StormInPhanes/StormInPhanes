My name is Kork Vingård and I'm the half-orc son of a barbarian orc warrior named Slår Vingård and a human mother, Harla Glade. My father Slår used to be a member of Ulrugh the Boulder's barbarian tribe, a cruel and vicious band of orcs who ransacked the westernmost villages of Mandina as a primary source of livelihood. He was still young and impressionable when, as his first proper mission, Ulrugh himself tasked him to sneak into a human village by nighttime to investigate the town's defensive armaments. The eager to please youngster found himself dumbstruck when, peeking into the window of one of the first houses of the village, he saw the most angelic creature he had ever seen. 
Harla Glade, my mother, used to live in a small border village of Mandina. She is the daughter of a gravedigger, her mother, and an embalmer, her father. She has hair as black as the northern sky and skin as fair as the moon, or at least that's how my father Slår described her when, as a kid, he told me the story of their first encounter. Harla loved singing and she used to stay up late at night singing to her number one fan, a stuffed crow that her father gifted her when she turned 18, named Scare. Nighttime was a perfect time to train her singing since no one was bothered by her. Their house was located close to the cemetery, in the outskirts of the village, and her parents slept like dead men.
That's what my father saw and heard that night when he looked through that window and that's when he decided that he was going to lie to Ulrugh about the defensive capabilities of the village. "The village is heavily guarded, I don't even know how I managed to sneak out unnoticed. They have ballistas, heavy arbalets and all sort of defensive equipment at the ready. We should skip this one." That's what he told Ulrugh after his return.
*It's important to note that before that day my father had never been directly confronted directly with violence. Orc children are each tribe's most valuable possession and they are heavily shielded from the outside world. As a youngling he was trained in martial combat and he loved to listen to the gory campfire stories that the Ulrugh warriors used to tell, but he had never been confronted with real life violence. "One day I'm gonna be the strongest warrior of the clan", he used to tell himself."*
That night my father realized that his tribe was stealing not only people's possessions but people's lives too. That was the moment he was not going to be a part of it anymore. That was moment he decided that he wanted to meet that girl. 
He started slipping away from camp at night and went to the small house at the outskirts of the village to listen to Harla's songs.
One night Harla was singing a beautiful ballad to Scare when she heard a crackling sound outside her window. She turned and saw a massive orc, dressed in heavy armor, a big battle-axe tied behind his back, staring at her. She started screaming but of course her parents never woke up. That's when Slår opened the door and said "Please don't be afraid, oh dazzling girl. I'm just hear to hear your beautiful voice". That was the beginning of their love story. Harla never revealed their romance to her parents since she knew they would never have accepted a barbarian orc as a bride to her daughter.
After one year my mother became pregnant and my father, who in the meantime became a proficient trapper of the Ulrugh tribe, knew that it was finally the time for him to abandon the tribe and start a new life with Harla.
One night he slipped away from the camp to that same small house, one last time. That night Harla and Slår rode away into the misty unknown future, towards the east, towards the town of [[Zamakrach]].
They built a life there, my father kept on earning his life as a trapper and my mother became a fairly successful singer at the city's theatre/concert venue/tavern.
My father taught me how to fight and how to defend myself the same way the older warriors of the Ulrugh tribe taught him. He told me to never hurt any innocent people and that violence should only be used in extreme situations. My mom tried to teach me how to sing but It was clear from the beginning that the her gift was not transferred to me by mere birthright.
What was instead very obvious to both was my love for poetry, literature and linguistics. I used to spend all the time I could lost among the shelves of the town's library, every time I could.
My father, intended to give me a better future than the one that was forced upon them as young adults, decided to participate to one of the werewolves blood hunts. *A blood hunt is a survival competition of peasants against werewolves. Peasants would volunteer to be chased, if they survive the night they get huge amount of money, if they get caught they die.* Considering both his fighting skills and his wildlife expertise, my father managed to stay alive and got repaid with a huge amount of money. My parents put most of that money to the side to pay me a trip to Caducea, and pay my tuition expenses. It was well known to them that Caducea offered amazing opportunities for young inspired student, a massive library as well as a certain open-mindedness concerning people's background and racial traits.
I moved to Caducea at the age of 19 and I joined the [[Hermetic Order]] right after that.
At first, it was very hard to socialize with other students, my appearance tends to drive people away and I didn't have much time to socialize anyways. I spent all my time either in class (my favorite courses where literature, poetry and of course linguistics) or at the library. It was at the library that I found my first real friend, Buldreath Frostforge, a dwarven student. My favorite wing of the foreign literature one and that Buldreath was there almost every time too. It didn't take much for him to introduce himself to me. One day he walked up and said "Hello, I'm Buldreath Frostforge. I'm pleased to note that your passion for foreign literature is as profound as mine". That was the beginning of our friendship. Buldreath is a bit older than me and he was already, at that time, an adept of the hermetic order and the assistant of professor Negwen Lonecrest. [[Professor Lonecrest]], a female halfling, was one of my teachers and the chair of comparative literature. 
Buldreath introduced me to other students and also gave me the possibility to getting to know [[Professor Lonecrest]] in a different context.
Through my excellent grades and the tutelage of [[Professor Lonecrest]], I managed to get my master degree/become an adept of the hermetic order. That gave me access to both some parts of the unseen archives (an archive of tomes that contains information that are cognitohazardous or very powerful, such information includes the words of power, which is magic in the purest form) as well as part of the deeper agenda of the hermetic order.
After I became an adept Buldreath was finally able to tell me that [[Caducea]] had big plans for the newly discovered Phanes archipelago and that the hermetic order has a big role to play. [[Professor Lonecrest]] started tasking me to do some very specific research about cultures using hieroglyph characters in relation to the [[Antediluvians]].
Last year, Buldreath informed me that him and [[Professor Lonecrest]] where going to go to [[Phanes]] to study some ruins. He was not able to tell me more since the mission was top secret and I didn't have the security clearance required to access that information. After Buldreath and Lonecrest left I kept deepening my studies in linguistics and comparative literature ad I kept in contact Buldreath through epistolary correspondence (we both promised that we would write each other one letter every month, since it is hard to send and receive news from Phanes). Three months ago I received the last letter from Buldreath. He informed me that they were on the verge of an impressive discovery. After that letter, nothing came the month after, neither this month.
The inexplicable lack of news certainly meant that something bad happened to Buldreath and [[Professor Lonecrest]] and it is now my duty to go to [[Phanes]] to find them.
