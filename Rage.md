A drug usually used by buccaneers.
Also used by [[Damian Moreau]] to keep his guards sharp and strong. It takes the form of blue dust. The problem with Rage is that it can cause problems to blood vessels and, when taken in high quantity, death. People who take Rage have red eyes and black veins.

Probably produced with salts from the north of [[Umun]].

[[Miller]] produced Rage for the buccaneers and possibly for [[Damian Moreau]] too.
