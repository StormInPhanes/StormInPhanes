Old [[Antediluvians]] cathedral-looking temple located south of [[Vagrant's Retreat]] and dedicated to [[Bes]]. The temple sits inside a walled citadel, all in ruin. It has two towers at the corners of the main entrance wall. One of the towers is partially collapsed and the other one has a brass bell near the top of it. In the main room there is a statue of [[Bes]] stepping on a giant creature's head. The inscription under the statue says: "Bes, slayer of giants, the first unifier of tribes". [[Antediluvians]] leave fresh offerings underneath it.
LPH had their first encounter with an [[Antediluvians]], a [[Stargazers]], there.
