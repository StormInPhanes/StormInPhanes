Caducea is a city state and the most influential and prosperous province in Umun, and its undeclared capital. It stands as a bustling metropolis, teeming with culture and science. The province is renowned for its multitude of esteemed alchemists who relentlessly push the boundaries of scientific exploration. Being a seaport on the delta on one of the biggest rivers, Caducea is also the centre of trading. Nestled along the shores of a massive river delta, Caducea serves as the epicenter of trade. Merchants from [[Zykh]], the lofty mountain abodes of [[Seid]], and every corner of the Umun Kingdoms are always busy peddling wares on the docs of the city.   

Rule. Under the rule of a lineage of sorcerer kings known as [[Demiurges]], Caducea has thrived.
