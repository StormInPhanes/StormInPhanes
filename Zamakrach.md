Zamakrach is a lake town close to [[Mandina]]'s western border.  
Zamakrach is a huge lake with many small islands, the area is surrounded by swamps and cedar forests. The lake has a legend. Long time ago there was a big island in the lake, upon which a magnificent castle stood. In this castle the ruler of the kingdom lived, and he was proud and cocky. He mocked the gods and didn't sacrifice the animals to [[Perun]] as was a custom. This angered the god of storms, but the king built lightning rods around the castle that protected him from the god's wrath. But one day came a storm so terrible that the island and the castle sunk into the lake. People sometimes find pearls in the muck and they call them king's troves.
