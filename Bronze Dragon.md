Probably an adult and ancient golden or bronze dragon. 30-40ft long. Legends says it is kind of a patron of the island of [[Sif]].

Spotted twice by LPH:
- First time near the [[Candle (lighthouse)]], it was fighting one of the [[Sea demon monsters]].
- Second time near [[Vagrant's Retreat]].

BBEG or new pet? I hope is the latter.
