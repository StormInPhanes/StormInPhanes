He is the governor of [[Sif]] and rules over [[Gray Port]]. He lives in the fort on the eastern side of the city.
He commands the [[City Watch]] and disposes of the help of the [[Emerald Enclave]] guards stationed in [[Gray Port]].

He is a cunning man.
- According to [[Jasper Seraph]] he has established trade routes with [[Molekith]] even though there is a conflict between [[Caducea]] and [[Molekith]].
- He was able to find out that [[Akira]] was spying on him and managed to imprison her.
- He distributes a deadly drug called [[Rage]] to his soldiers to turn them into Captain America.
- [[Jonah Blackthorn]] told LPH that [[Jeremiah Crow]] has a secret dealing with Damian Moreau. On one hand Damian Moreau buys treasures and the chemicals to produce [[Rage]] from the buccaneers and leaves [[Vagrant's Retreat]] alone, and on the other hand [[Jeremiah Crow]] agrees not to attack [[Caducea]]n ships and not to get involved in any weapon dealings with [[Molekith]]. Ties between the two can also be deduced from the fact that both the box of muskets that Moreau told LPH to look for at the [[Gray Port Warehouse]] and a crate spotted on the [[Cleaver]] boast the same insignia of a crow perched on a battleaxe.

For now it seems like this Machiavellian character is playing dirty but his goal seems to be to destabilize [[Molekith]], which makes his action as a [[Caducea]]n governor aligned with [[Caducea]]'s goals.
