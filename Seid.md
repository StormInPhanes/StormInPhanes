Seid are the biggest dwarven civilization in [[Umun]], occupying the mountain range in the north. They engage in extensive trade, leveraging their highly coveted craftsmanship and goods with neighboring nations. Seid show little concern for the intricate political affairs of human nations and are willing to conduct business with anyone who respects their traditions and have the means to pay.

Governance among the Seid is overseen by influential clan elders, who manage local matters and answer only the high king. Seid devote themselves to a huge pantheon of gods, but most of all they worship [[Velen]] - the god of the underground and a psychopomp. 

Although the Seid seldom venture beyond their mountainous home or embark on oceanic journeys, they were stirred by rumors of valuable adamantine deposits in [[Phanes]]. This prompted them to set aside their differences with the surface-dwelling communities, and they jointly embarked on a colonization expedition with [[Caducea]].

In [[Phanes]] they are present in [[Perun]].
