A lineage of sorcerer kings and the rulers of [[Caducea]].

These rulers are held in the highest esteem by the Caduceans, revered as just and mighty beings. Indeed, the demiurge is believed to have transcended the mortal realm ([[Pleroma]]), being worshipped as a living deity. Clerics and warlocks have the option to select the demiurge as their patron or deity. It is believed that demiurges inherit their wisdom and knowledge through a form of reincarnation, passed down from their ancestors.
