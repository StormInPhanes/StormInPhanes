Protogonus is an [[Umun]]ian term to call the “World”, which also translates to an “Egg” it the olden dialect. The known geography of the world features two monolithic continents, in the west [[Umun]] and [[Zykh]] to the east. The lands are separated by the treacherous [[Silvery Ocean]], called so for its waters at times become opaque and shine in the sun as it grows fat with swarms of plankton. 

In many religions the world itself is considered a living god, the [[Umun]]ians worship Protogonus, the god that sleeps in his egg, and dreams of everything that’s happening. The people of [[Zykh]] worship the eternal phoenix, that burns from an egg and then destroys itself once again to become an egg, thus completing the cycle of reincarnation. The doomsday cults believe that world is an alien egg, an entity of primeval chaos, they perform strange rituals in hopes to awaken the sleeping god.
