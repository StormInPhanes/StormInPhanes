Precious bright green artifact gems. According to what [[Maurice Dellunay]] told LPH, the gems are part of a secret [[Emerald Enclave]] project and the existence of these gems should not be public knowledge. The gems are supposed to have magical properties.

[[Maurice Dellunay]] was in possession of a bunch of them, previously owned by Bug and stored in his fiddle (Bug stole the gems from the Emerald Enclave either on the ship or before embarking) and LPH helped him deliver them to [[Jeremiah Crow]].
