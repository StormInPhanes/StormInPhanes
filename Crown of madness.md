The central island of the [[Phanes]] archipelago. It has volcanic origin stands encircled by an assortment of rocky islets. Shrouded by a perpetual storm and guarded by cliffs and [[Antediluvians]] tribes the place is nigh inaccessible.

[[Jeremiah Crow]] has maps of the Crown of madness, maybe he was able to explore the island?
