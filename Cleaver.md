[[Jeremiah Crow]] "beached" ship in [[Vagrant's Retreat]]. The ship sits magically up a cliff, it looks fully capable of sailing and it seems like it has been placed there without taking any type of damage. It has black flags an no sails. The inside of the ship is decorated with taxidermy animals.
Crow's office is very neat and simple but on his table there are multiple detailed maps of the region.

A box with the insignia of a crow perched on a battleaxe is spotted by LPH. The same insignia has been seen by LPH before. At the [[Gray Port Warehouse]] a box of muskets that [[Damian Moreau]] told LPH to look for a box with that insignia.
