Mandina is situated in the [[Northern lands]]. Mandina consists of numerous fishing villages along the shores of the [[Silvery Ocean]]. It is under the official dominion of a ruthless werewolf family, who reside in shadowy castles and often prey on the local population, rarely taking action to improve the welfare of their subjects. Consequently, most communities in this area are largely self-governed.

[[Brunhilde]] and [[Kork Ving√•rd]] (originally), are from Mandina.
