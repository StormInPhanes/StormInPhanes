Molekith, an empire hailing from the distant reaches of Zykh, is a formidable and imposing nation under the rule of the cunning [[Empress Naamah]]. She is not only a renowned warrior but also an astute strategist, often seen riding into battle atop a fearsome bull.

The core belief of Molekith is deeply entrenched in the notion that might makes right, with a prevailing philosophy that those who cannot defend themselves are deemed unworthy and easily overcome. This inherent aggressiveness drives Molekith to be aggressive expansionists, constantly seeking to extend their dominion.

Molekith's religious practices revolve around a pantheon of deities to whom they offer fervent prayers and solemn sacrifices. Among their gods, one deity holds a special place in their devotion - the demon god [[Molokh]], who embodies elements of fertility and sacrifice, reflecting the empire's complex and sometimes dark spirituality.

In their relentless pursuit of power and dominance, Molekith has not shed away from the subjugation of lesser nations, often enslaving those they conquer. Their empire stands as a formidable force on the world stage, shaped by their unwavering faith in their warrior empress, their aggressive expansionist tendencies, and their unique blend of religious worship that incorporates both the divine and the demonic.
