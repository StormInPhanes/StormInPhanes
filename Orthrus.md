A somewhat plain island in the [[Phanes]] archipelago. Split in two by a mountain array. Adamantine is found here which mines are claimed by [[Molekith]] in the eastern half of the island. [[Caducea]]ns established an outpost on the western shore with intent to contest the [[Molekith]]'s control over the island.

[[Jasper Seraph]] informs the party that the island is being attacked by raiders and that the [[Molekith]] authorities in Orthrus have managed to enslave the [[Antediluvians]] of the island.
