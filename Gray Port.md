The first outpost and the only city established by [[Caducea]] on the island of [[Sif]]. Located in the south side of the island, it is divided in two by a river that comes from the mountains up north.

After the attack of the [[Sea demon monsters]] the bridge has been barricaded. The port side of the city is completely overrun by monsters.
Also after the attack, the river water has been rendered undrinkable due to the presence of a poisonous organic substance that affects the bloodstream.
