## Phanes

![[pictures/Phanes Map Handpainted.jpeg]]

Phanes is an enigmatic archipelago distant from the mainland's shores, nestled in the most treacherous part of the [[Silvery Ocean]], known for its capricious weather and strange creatures lurking in the depths.

Phanes was found merely seven years ago, a discovery made by an unfortunate merchant mariner known as "[[Leif the Red]]" and his ill-fated crew.
Cast adrift onto the Perun coast due to a shipwreck, they managed to summon aid through sending stones. Regrettably, the search and rescue party dispatched to the island found no survivors among the marooned crew. Nonetheless, their efforts were not in vain, for the explorers did not return empty-handed. Amidst the rugged cliffs that punctuated the coastline, the sailors came upon the haunting remains of an ancient city. This city, shrouded in an air of eldritch mystery, exhibited obsidian walls adorned with macabre gargoyles and peculiar murals. Its labyrinthine streets were paved with intricate mosaics, which depicted the visages of wrathful deities. The city's central squares showcased thickets of columns that spiraled toward the heavens, a testament to a bygone grandeur.

Stretching forth into the verdant jungle, the eerie city melded seamlessly with the colossal roots of the towering trees, adorned in veils of moss, both above and below ground. In the subterranean labyrinthine passages, the intrepid explorers stumbled upon caches of treasure belonging to the long-lost civilization. Among the priceless artefacts, the pinnacle of their discovery was a collection of garments forged from the purest adamantine.

With their newfound riches, the explorers returned to the city of [[Caducea]], their wealth unparalleled and their tales of adventure echoing far and wide across the lands. The rumors of their exploits served only to deepen the intrigue surrounding the mystifying realm of Phanes which triggered a race to claim the islands.

The proud Caduceans organized an expedition in collaboration with the grouchy dwarves residing in the [[Seid]] mountains. However, upon arrival, they discovered that the fierce forces of [[Molekith]] were already engaged in adamantine mining in [[Orthrus]] and looting ruins in [[Chors]].

1. [[Sif]]. A forested island claimed by [[Caducea]]ns.
2. [[Perun]]. Originally called “Leif’s landing” the island was renamed “[[Perun]]” in honor of the chief deity of [[Seid]] who claimed this island as their stronghold.
3. [[Hafguf]]. A rocky massif surrounded by unscalable cliffs. Home to rare bird species and harpies.
4. [[Orthrus]]. A somewhat plain island split in two by a mountain array. Adamantine is found here which mines are claimed by [[Molekith]] in the eastern half of the island. [[Caducea]]ns established an outpost on the western shore with intent to contest the island’s control.
5. [[Chors]]. A small island featuring a [[Molekith]] fort.
6. [[Typheus]]. Rocky isle with a huge freshwater lake. A few [[Antediluvians]] tribes clash here with a [[Molekith]] outpost.
7. [[Crown of madness]]. An island of volcanic origin stands encircled by an assortment of rocky islets. Shrouded by a perpetual storm and guarded by cliffs and [[Antediluvians]] tribes the place is nigh inaccessible.

## Ecology

Phanes is home to a diverse flora and fauna, much of which is exclusive to this region alone. Many plants and fungi growing here can only be found in feywild, including uncommon types of moss rumored to possess healing properties, mushrooms emitting an eerie glow and trees that serenade the night with melancholic melodies. This area is thought to have a thin barrier separating it from the fey realm, a notion supported by the rumors of a secretive coven of sea witches hatching plots.

The wooded fringes of the islands harbor a host of cunning creatures: predatory theropods stalk the undergrowth, majestic rocs circle the mountain peaks, and harpies steer sailors with their captivating tunes into the cliffs. Yet, the true marvels lie beneath the waves. Electric eels, colossal squid-sharks, and forgotten beasts of unparalleled proportions are believed to roam the unfathomable depths.

Tribal communities of native people named as “[[Antediluvians]]” steer away from the colonizers. They lurk in the ruins and mountain caverns, where they perform occult rituals, perhaps summoning wrathful storms and sea beasts onto the invaders. Nobody knows for sure for they are elusive in nature and speak in tongues only themselves understand.  

Much is yet unknown about the exact ecology of the archipelago, magical phenomena and pockets of wild magic often erupt transforming the landscape.
