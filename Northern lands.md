Northern lands is an umbrella term for a region in [[Umun]] that spans to the north of the [[Seid]] mountains. This tundra is sparsely civilized, save for the numerous fishing villages along the shores of [[Mandina]]. Additionally, the Northern Lands are inhabited by various orcish barbarian tribes that roam the wastelands to the west of Mandina. On occasion, these tribes descend upon human settlements to engage in trade and integrate into human society.  The Northern lands are densely covered with cedar and pine forests which are home to Umun’s most dangerous, that prey on travelers and hunters. People hailing from northern lands are known to be reserved and thick skinned.
