A forested island claimed by [[Caducea]]ns.

A [[Bronze Dragon]] lives in the mountain in the middle of the island. LPH saw it twice already but had no further interactions with it. Looks like the dragon is not interest in humanoid settlements.

Locations:
- [[Gray Port]]
- [[Vagrant's Retreat]]
- [[Temple of Bes]]
