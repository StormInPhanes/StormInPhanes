A tavern located on the port side of [[Gray Port]]. Designated as meeting point for all the refugees that came from the port side of [[Gray Port]] after the [[Sea demon monsters]] attack.

The innkeeper and owner of Sif's Charity is Rosanna.

Connected to the [[Sailor's Melody]] through an underground railroad tunnel used for smuggling, it is infested by monsters though.
