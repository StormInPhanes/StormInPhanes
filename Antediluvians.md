Tribal communities natives of [[Phanes]]. People named as “Antediluvians” steer away from the colonizers. They lurk in the ruins and mountain caverns, where they perform occult rituals, perhaps summoning wrathful storms and sea beasts onto the invaders. Nobody knows for sure for they are elusive in nature and speak in tongues only themselves understand.

In [[Phanes]] they are present in [[Typheus]] and on the [[Crown of madness]].

But apparently Antediluvians are present in [[Orthrus]] too. [[Jasper Seraph]] informed LPH that [[Molekith]] authorities have enslaved Antediluvians there.

Antediluvian are present in [[Sif]] too. LPH had an encounter with a very tall, blueish creature that was able to perform 4th level transmutation spells (he polymorphed [[Maurice Dellunay]] into a turtle) in at the [[Temple of Bes]] near [[Vagrant's Retreat]] on [[Sif]]. The Antediluvian could also turn into a dragon constellation form, the same form that [[Triya]] can take.

The Antediluvian LPH encountered is probably one of the [[Stargazers]].
