There are four main orders in [[Caducea]] which are the branches that extend the [[Demiurges]]'s will: the [[Hermetic Order]], the Grave Knights, the [[Emerald Enclave]] and the [[Albedo Union]].

Grave knights refuse the afterlife to serve the [[Demiurges]], they are very powerful undead creatures which makes them powerful combatants.

They have a conflictual relationship with the [[Emerald Enclave]].

[[Sister Vidomina]] is the chief representative of the Grave Knights in [[Sif]].
